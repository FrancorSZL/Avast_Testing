# Avast_Testing
QA intern homework
## Manual testing task:
Create and present a structured bug report in English

Web page for test: https://www.avast.com/business/products/qa-intern-business-antivirus-
pro-plus

Test definition: Please create a bug report that will be sorted and structured based on
severity of the bugs found. You can use a text editor, tables or a professional tool (if you use
one, please let us know which one). Do not test any other pages than the one mentioned
above.

Note: In case of testing the cart always use the incognito window or delete cache before
going back on the page to protect the integrity of the test results. The method you use to test
this page is not important, neither are the tools you use for the testing. The important thing is
that the results are logically structured and encompass all the important parts of the page and
bugs found.
